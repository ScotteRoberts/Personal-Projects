# Learning Markdown
We are going to learn as we go, so hold your horses.
## H2
That was an '\<h2\>' html tag. The sizes continue to get smaller the more '#' you add.
Alright, from here on the headers will mark the sections appropriately.

## Emphasis
Make sure you ***emphasize*** what I am saying...

### Italics
The example above used italics '\*' or '\_' on either side of the text.

### Bold
The example above used bolded letters '\*\*' or '\_\_' on either side of the text.

## Lists
Supposedly you can make any program using lists. Fancy that.

### Unordered Lists
You have to use an **asterix** and a **space** '\* ' to mark a bullet point.
* Like this
* Or this
  * With this

### Ordered Lists
You have to use **numbers** and a **period** '1\.' to mark a numbered element.
1. Like this
2. Or this
    * Mixed with this (This bullet point needed a double tab to work)
    
## Images
YAYYYYYY
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

## Links
Links have an automatic hyperlink attached - http://github.com 

You can also Set an alias for your site - [GitHub](http://github.com)

## BlockQuotes
I think these are some of my favorite because...
> They offer a nice break in the page

## Username Mentions (@)
If you want notify another user of the documents or code your are working on, you can "mention" that person be using the at-symbol then the username '@scotteroberts'

## Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>markup tags</del> supported
- [x] completed item
- [ ] not completed itme

## Fenced Code Blocks
This is the meat and potatoes of any given markdown document. The code example. Without this, I have no idea where I would be or what crazy sites I would look at. Maybe some C#.
```cs
public void GetJunk()
{
  AskNicely();
}
```
Or some javascript...
```javascript
function callback (callback) {
  console.log(callback)
}
```

## Tables
These are pretty cool, but not sure how many I can make... Lets try a 2x2

Header 1 | Header 2
-------- | --------
Hello     | World

That was cool, but what else can we make?

Header 1 | Header 2 | Weird | hmm...
--- | --- | --- | ---
**FUN** | ***IS*** | SOOOOOOOOOO... | :octocat:
